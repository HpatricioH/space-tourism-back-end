# Space tourism Website - API

This is the API that serves with get endpoints for crew, destination & technology. Mysql and ORM prisma was used to keep practicing the development with this tools

## Overview

### The challenge

Back-end API that created four Get endpoints which are used to send data once is requested from the [front-end](https://github.com/HpatricioH/space-tourism-front-end/tree/main) of the website

## My process

### Built with

- [MySQL](https://www.mysql.com/) - Data Base 
- [Prisma](https://www.prisma.io/) - ORM


### What I learned

This API was created with the intention of keep practicing how to implement a back-end that serves the front-end with one GET method that sends data of all the crew members, destinations and technology. 

This API was created using a versioning to implement better practices into the project.
